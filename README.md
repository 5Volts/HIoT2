The process of designing devices like smartphones, computers, and cars are known as engineering. When homo sapiens created fire camps to sustain fires for various activities like cooking food and staying warm, that is also known as engineering!

Today we will make a device that possess similar features like the creation our ancestors has made. And we will make it better!
